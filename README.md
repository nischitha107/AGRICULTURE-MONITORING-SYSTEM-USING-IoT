🌱 Agriculture Monitoring System Using IoT

This project was developed during my internship at JOAI Pvt. Ltd. as part of an academic and industry-oriented learning experience. The system focuses on improving agricultural efficiency through real-time monitoring and automated decision support using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.

The solution integrates sensors to continuously monitor soil moisture, temperature, and rainfall conditions. Based on real-time sensor data, the system automates irrigation control to prevent overwatering and water wastage while maintaining optimal soil conditions for crops. An Arduino-based microcontroller acts as the central processing unit, coordinating sensor inputs and controlling actuators such as water pumps and display modules.

The project emphasizes practical implementation, hardware–software integration, and real-world problem solving. It demonstrates how IoT-enabled agriculture can support sustainable farming practices, reduce manual intervention, and improve resource utilization.

Technologies used include Arduino, soil moisture sensors, rain sensors, temperature sensors, embedded C programming, and basic IoT communication concepts. This project provided hands-on exposure to IoT system design, sensor integration, real-time monitoring, and automated control systems.
